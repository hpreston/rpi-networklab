# Raspberry Pi and Network Lab 
The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive computer that makes a great addition to everyone's network lab.  In fact, you might want to pickup a few of them for your lab.  

This repository includes some documents I've put together with some ideas on how and where a RPi can be used in a network lab, as well as some quick guides to help you get started quickly.  This repository is a work in progress, and some of the guides may not be complete yet.  

## Raspberry Pi Resources and Overview 
I am not going to try to replace the wonderful official documentation available for getting started and setting up a Raspberry Pi.  If you are new to RPi, here are very useful links to get started.
